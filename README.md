# Gesture-Based Windows Controller

A Python-based tool to control basic Windows window management functions like switching, minimizing, and maximizing windows using **hand gestures** captured from a webcam.

## Motivation

Ever felt too lazy to press Alt + Tab?  
I did.  
So I decided to make my laptop listen to my hands instead.  

This started as a fun detour while I was learning the MERN stack — and ended up becoming a useful gesture-control utility that could be scaled into something more meaningful.
